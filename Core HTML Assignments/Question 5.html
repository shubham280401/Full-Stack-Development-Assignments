        <dt><strong>Frontend Tech Stack:</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The frontend tech stack is the client’s side of the application. Client-side refers to anything that a user can see or engage with on a screen.It is responsible for the design, format, and navigation of websites or web apps
            It includes technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building and styling web pages and making them interactive.

        <dt><strong>Backend Tech Stack:</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            It refers to the inner workings of a website or app that users cannot see. Think of it as the electric power stations that generate electricity for your home. They may seem invisible in the background, but they are important to keep the operations running smoothly.
            It manages data, user authentication, and performs server-side logic. Common technologies include Node.js, Python, Ruby, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB.

        <dt><strong>LAMP:</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            LAMP is an industry-standard when it comes to tech stack models. In web development, it delivers the best cost efficiency, flexibility, and performance.
            It includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Linux(Operating System)</li>
                <li>Apache (HTTP server)</li>
                <li>MySQL (relational database management)</li>
                <li>PHP (programming language, it can also be Perl or Python)</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <br>

        <dt><strong>ASP.NET:</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            Microsoft’s .NET Core has been growing in popularity in recent years. Modern .NET applications are very lightweight and can run on Windows and Linux. Microsoft’s embrace of open source technologies has caught the attention of developers all over the world. Now with .NET 5, you don’t have to think as much about .NET Framework vs .NET Core.
            Applications built using .NET commonly use the following application tech stack:
            <ul>
                <li>ASP.NET MVC – Standard model-view-controller framework</li>
                <li>IIS – Microsoft’s web server</li>
                <li>Angular frontend framework with TypeScript</li>
                <li>SQL Server – Microsoft’s enterprise database</li>
                <li>Microsoft Azure – A favorite of most .NET developers</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <br>

        <dt><strong>MEAN:</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            One of the well-known tech stacks, MEAN brings numerous benefits to web developers. Among these benefits are the use of a single language (JavaScript) and the underlying technologies are open source and free.
             MEAN consists of:
             <ul>
                <li>MongoDB (NoSQL database)</li>
                <li>Express.js backend web framework</li>
                <li>Angular.js frontend framework</li>
                <li>Node.js server-side JavaScript</li>
             </ul>
        </dd>
        <br>

        <dt><strong>MERN:</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            Essentially MERN is similar to MEAN. The difference is that you change Angular.js with React.
            The key benefits of using MERN are the React integration, the ability to use code on browsers and servers simultaneously, powerful library, and full-stack development option (frontend and backend).
            Additionally, React is known for its flexibility and performance in developing interactive user interfaces.
