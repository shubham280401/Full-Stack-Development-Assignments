The comma (,) operator evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand. This is commonly used to provide multiple updaters to a for loop's afterthought.

Synatx:

expression1, expression2, expression3, ..., expressionN


Usage:

The comma operator is primarily used in situations where multiple expressions need to be evaluated, but only the result of the last expression matters.

The comma operator also allows the execution of multiple operations within a single line. It's also used when you want to perform sequential tasks but aren't interested in capturing or using the final value of the expression.
