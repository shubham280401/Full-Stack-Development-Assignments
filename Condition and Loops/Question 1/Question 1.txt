Conditional statements are fundamental in programming, allowing the execution of different code blocks based on certain conditions. They allow programs to make decisions and perform different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.


Syntax of if statement:

if (condition) {
    // code block to execute if the condition is true
}


Syntax of if-else statement:

if (condition) {
    // code block to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // code block to execute if the condition is false
}
 

Syntax of if-else-if ladder:

if (condition1) {
    // code block to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code block to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
    // code block to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}
