Loops in programming are control structures that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on certain conditions. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data.

### Why do we need loops?
Loops help in:
- **Repeating tasks**: Executing a set of instructions multiple times without writing repetitive code.
- **Iterating through data**: Processing arrays, lists, or other collections efficiently.
- **Making decisions**: Performing actions based on certain conditions until those conditions are met.

### Different types of loops:

#### 1. **For Loop:**
A `for` loop is used when you know the number of iterations needed.

##### Syntax (JavaScript):
```javascript
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```


#### 2. **While Loop:**
A `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown, but a condition is met.

##### Syntax (JavaScript):
```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```


#### 3. **Do-While Loop:**
A `do-while` loop is similar to a `while` loop, but it always executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition.

##### Syntax (JavaScript):
```javascript
do {
  // code block to be executed
} while (condition);
```
