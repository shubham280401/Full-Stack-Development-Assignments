1. Unary Operators:

Unary operators work with a single operand.
Examples:
++ (Increment): Increases the value of a variable by 1.
-- (Decrement): Decreases the value of a variable by 1.
! (Logical NOT): Negates a Boolean value, converting true to false and false to true.

2. Binary Operators:

Binary operators work with two operands.
Examples:
+ (Addition): Adds two values together.
- (Subtraction): Subtracts one value from another.
* (Multiplication): Multiplies two values.

3. Ternary Operator:

The ternary operator is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands.
Syntax: condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
It acts as a shorthand for an if-else statement, allowing you to make a decision based on a condition.
