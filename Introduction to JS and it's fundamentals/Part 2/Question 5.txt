Comments in JavaScript play a crucial role in code readability, documentation, and collaboration among developers. They're non-executable lines within the code that provide explanations, notes, or descriptions about the code itself. Here's why comments are important:

1. **Code Clarity:** Comments explain the purpose of code snippets, making it easier for others (or even yourself, in the future) to understand the intention behind certain operations or logic.

2. **Documentation:** They serve as a form of documentation, helping developers understand complex algorithms, functions, or any unconventional code structures.

3. **Debugging and Troubleshooting:** Comments can be used to temporarily disable certain code sections for debugging purposes without deleting them entirely.

4. **Collaboration:** When working in teams, comments facilitate communication among team members by providing context and explanations about specific code segments.

Here are examples of single-line and multi-line comments in JavaScript:

**Single-Line Comment:**
```javascript
// This is a single-line comment in JavaScript
let number = 5; // Assigning value 5 to the variable 'number'
```

**Multi-Line Comment:**
```javascript
/*
  This is a multi-line comment in JavaScript.
  It spans multiple lines and can contain detailed explanations.
  This is useful for providing in-depth documentation or commenting out blocks of code.
*/
let message = 'Hello, World!';
```
