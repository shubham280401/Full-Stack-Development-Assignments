Declaring variables in JavaScript serves the purpose of allocating memory to store data and giving that data a name or identifier that can be used throughout the code. It allows developers to create, access, and modify data within a program.

The `let` keyword is used in JavaScript to declare variables with block scope. Here's how you declare variables using `let`:

```javascript
let variableName; // Declaration without initialization
```

Here's a breakdown of using `let` for variable declaration:

1. **Using `let`:**
   - `let` is a keyword introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) for declaring variables.
   - It allows the declaration of variables that can be reassigned later.
   - Variables declared with `let` have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block ({ }) where they are defined.
   
2. **Declaration without Initialization:**
   - You can declare a variable using `let` without immediately assigning a value to it.
   - Example: `let age;`

3. **Declaration with Initialization:**
   - You can declare and assign a value to a variable using `let` in a single line.
   - Example: `let name = 'John';`

4. **Reassignment:**
   - Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned with a new value.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let count = 10;
     count = 15; // Reassignment is allowed
     ```

5. **Block Scope:**
   - Variables declared with `let` have block-level scope. They are only accessible within the block where they are defined.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     if (true) {
       let insideIf = 'Hello';
       console.log(insideIf); // Accessible here
     }
     console.log(insideIf); // Error: 'insideIf' is not defined outside the block
     ```

Declaring variables using `let` allows for better control over variable scoping and reassignment, leading to more predictable and maintainable code. It's a good practice to use `let` for variable declarations when the scope of the variable needs to be limited to a specific block.
