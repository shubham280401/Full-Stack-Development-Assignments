displayed in search engine results, helping users understand what a page is about before clicking on it. 

3.Correct Display in Browsers: Meta tags are used by web browsers to correctly render and display content. 

4.Competitive Advantage: Properly implemented meta tags can set your website apart from competitors. They allow you to craft compelling 
and informative snippets that entice users to click on your link in search results, potentially attracting more traffic than competing 
pages.
